## Introduction

Uber is a leading ride-hailing platform that generates vast amounts of data on rides, including timestamps, locations, and user ratings. Analyzing this data can provide valuable insights into customer preferences, peak hours, and geographic demand trends. This project leverages various data analysis techniques to uncover patterns in the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis can be obtained from:

- [Uber Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city)

The dataset includes features such as:

- **Date/Time**: Timestamp of the ride request
- **Pickup Location**: Latitude and longitude of the pickup point
- **Dropoff Location**: Latitude and longitude of the drop-off point
- **Passenger Count**: Number of passengers in the ride
- **Fare**: Fare amount for the ride
- **Rating**: User rating for the ride

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- [Any other libraries or tools you used]

## Analysis

The analysis includes the following key components:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing ride patterns, peak demand times, and geographic distribution of pickups and drop-offs.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Identifying trends over time, such as ride volume fluctuations based on day of the week or time of day.

## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations, such as:

- Heatmaps showing ride density across different neighborhoods
- Time series plots illustrating ride demand over time
- Bar charts comparing average fares by day of the week

## Usage
